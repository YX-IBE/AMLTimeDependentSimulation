# Simulation study for analyzing AML data with time-dependent models

This repository contains code for performing a simulation study in our commentary entitled "Do sophisticated models give the full picture of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation effect?", which is now under review. The simulation setting can be modified by altering the corresponding arguments of the functions.

The code has been run and tested in R 4.2.0.
